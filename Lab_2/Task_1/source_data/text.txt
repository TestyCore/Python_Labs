Seryozha and Dad were making a bird feeder. Seryozha served nails and planks.
Dad whittled them and put them together. In winter, Seryozha poured grain into
the feeder every morning. Sparrows and bluebirds were waiting for the boy.
They came from all sides, hurrying to have breakfast. On frosty days,
Seryozha fed his feathered friends often. A well-fed bird easily tolerates cold.
